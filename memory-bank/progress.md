# Project Progress

## What Works

- Project specification and architecture defined in `projectbrief.md` (recently updated for transcription feature).
- Memory bank documentation initialized and updated for core module refactoring.
- Initial versions of `core/audio_utils.py`, `core/diarization.py`, `core/clap_annotator.py` are implemented.
- `audio_utils.py` provides audio loading, normalization (with configurable LUFS), and resampling.
- `core/diarization.py` refactored to use `pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1` and performs segmentation as specified.
- `core/clap_annotator.py` refactored to use `microsoft/clap-htsat-unfused` as default.
- `audiosegmenter_cli.py` updated to correctly call refactored diarization and normalization, resolving previous import and TypeError issues.

## What's Left to Build/Refactor

- **NEW: Implement Transcription Module (`core/transcription.py`):**
  - Create `initialize_whisper_model` function to load `openai/whisper-large-v3` (or user-specified) using `transformers`.
  - Create `transcribe_segment` function to:
    - Load an audio segment.
    - Process and transcribe with Whisper, requesting word-level timestamps.
    - Return structured transcription data (text, relative timestamps).
  - Add helper functions for saving individual transcriptions (`.txt`, `.json`).

- **NEW: Integrate Transcription into CLI (`audiosegmenter_cli.py`):**
  - Add CLI options: `--transcribe`, `--whisper-model`, `--transcription-language`, `--word-timestamps`.
  - In the `process` command:
    - Initialize Whisper model if transcription is enabled.
    - After diarization/segmentation, iterate through the speaker segment manifest.
    - For each segment:
      - Call `transcribe_segment`.
      - Adjust timestamps to be global (relative to original audio start).
      - Save individual transcription files (`output_dir/transcripts/speaker_segments/...`).
    - Reconstruct and save the full transcript files (`output_dir/transcripts/full_transcript.json` and `.txt`).

- **Finalize Output & Reporting:**
  - Update `results_summary.json` in `audiosegmenter_cli.py` to include information about transcription outputs (paths, stats like total transcribed duration, etc.).
  - Ensure all output paths and file structures are consistent with `projectbrief.md`.

- **Testing & Refinement:**
  - Thoroughly test the complete pipeline: preprocessing -> diarization -> segmentation -> transcription -> CLAP annotation.
  - Test with various audio files and edge cases.
  - Refine error handling and logging across all modules.

- **Documentation:**
  - Update `README.md` with details on the new transcription feature, CLI options, and model requirements (especially for Whisper).

## Known Issues

- (Previous model/logic issues are now resolved by refactoring)
- **NEW (Potential):** Performance of Whisper `large-v3` on CPU or low-VRAM GPUs needs to be documented as a consideration for users.
- **NEW (Potential):** Management of Hugging Face model downloads/cache for multiple large models (Pyannote, CLAP, Whisper) should be smooth for the user.
