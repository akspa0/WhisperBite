# Progress Status

## What Works

### 1. Core Functionality
- ✅ Audio file processing
- ✅ Video audio extraction
- ✅ Vocal separation (Demucs) - *Standard workflow*
- ✅ Sound detection (CLAP) - *Standard workflow*
- ✅ Event detection (CLAP - Refactored) - *Functional via run_clap_event_detection*
- ✅ Speaker Diarization (Pyannote)
- ✅ Transcription (Whisper) - *Standard workflow*
- ✅ Stereo Splitting
- ✅ Audio Normalization
- ✅ Stop/Cancel Mechanism (UI -> Backend)
- ✅ Output Directory Structure (Unique run directories)
- ✅ Per-run File Logging
- ✅ UI Clarity & Configuration (Basic presets and controls)
- ✅ Two-Pass Workflow Logic (Core logic in `whisperBite.py`)

### 2. Features
- ✅ Multiple input formats (File, Folder, URL)
- ✅ Video audio extraction
- ✅ Audio normalization
- ✅ Vocal/Non-vocal separation (Standard workflow)
- ✅ Speaker count detection (manual/auto)
- ✅ Second-pass diarization refinement (mono path)
- ✅ Word-level timestamps/audio (optional)
- ✅ Event-guided segmentation (`cut_audio_between_events` based on Pass 1)
- ✅ Per-segment annotation (`extract_soundbites`, Pass 2 CLAP)
- ✅ Per-segment transcription
- ✅ Configurable Event/Sound Detection (Separate UI controls, presets)
- ⚠️ Stereo Split Second Pass - *Not implemented*
- ⚠️ Per-channel Auto Speaker Detection (Stereo Split) - *Not implemented*

## Current Status

### 1. UI & Configuration
```status
✅ UI Refactored (Detection Tab)
✅ Preset interactivity for standard detection controls implemented
✅ Configuration flow for detection reworked
✅ Basic preset selection works
🟥 Preset structure fixed (`KeyError: 'config'`)
🟥 Event-Guided preset UI needs completion (Pass 1 prompt override textbox and logic)
```

### 2. Processing Pipeline
```status
✅ Core steps (normalize, separate, diarize, transcribe) functional for standard workflows.
✅ Stop mechanism functional
✅ Event/Sound detection configuration flow correct
✅ CLAP Event Detection (Refactored `run_clap_event_detection`) functional.
✅ Two-Pass Workflow (`Event-Guided` preset logic in `whisperBite.py`) implemented.
✅ Standard workflow logic restored in `whisperBite.py`.
🟥 `sound_detection.py` logger fixed (`NameError: name 'logger'`).
```

### 3. Output Organization
```status
✅ Unique run directory created
✅ Step-specific subdirectories planned/created (e.g., `normalized/`, `conversation_segments/`, `soundbites/`)
✅ Basic YAML/Text output generated (needs update for two-pass structure)
✅ Per-run log file (`processing.log`) created
```

## Implementation Progress

### 1. Completed / Fixed
- Basic audio processing pipeline setup
- Vocal separation (Demucs)
- Diarization & Transcription (Pyannote, Whisper)
- Sound Detection Integration (CLAP - standard workflow)
- Stereo Splitting
- Second Pass (Mono)
- Stop mechanism implementation
- UI Refactoring: Detection Tab, separate controls, preset interactivity.
- Output Directory Restoration: Unique, timestamped run directory.
- Configuration Flow Rework: Distinct Event/Sound detection paths.
- File Logging: Per-run `processing.log`.
- ✅ **CLAP Event Detection Refactoring:** Replaced `EventDetector` class with `run_clap_event_detection` function.
- ✅ **Two-Pass Workflow Implementation:** Logic added to `whisperBite.py` to support segmenting based on Pass 1 and processing segments in Pass 2.
- ✅ **Standard Workflow Restoration:** Re-added conditional logic for standard presets in `whisperBite.py`.
- Fixes: `stop_event` AttributeError, `KeyError: 'workflow'`, `KeyError: 'name'`, `TypeError` in transcription loop, Prompt handling, Empty prompt filtering, `json` import error, `KeyError: 'config'` in presets, `NameError: logger` in `sound_detection.py`.

### 2. In Progress
- **Fixing `app.py` UI for Two-Pass Workflow:** Adding the specific UI controls (Pass 1 prompt override) and connecting the logic in `run_pipeline` and `update_ui_for_preset` to handle the "Event-Guided" preset correctly.

### 3. Planned (Post-UI Fix)
- Testing "Event-Guided" preset end-to-end.
- Testing standard presets ("Standard", "Transcription") end-to-end.
- Refining YAML/Master Transcript output for the two-pass structure.
- Investigation of detection thresholds.
- Stereo split second-pass implementation.
- Per-channel auto speaker detection for stereo split.
- Packaging (Pinokio).

## Next Steps

### 1. Immediate
- **Fix `app.py`:** Re-attempt the edits to add the Pass 1 prompt override textbox and update the relevant functions (`update_ui_for_preset`, `run_pipeline`, `.change`, `.click` handlers) in smaller, targeted steps.

### 2. Short Term
- **Test UI Interactivity:** Verify the Pass 1 prompt box appears/disappears correctly when changing presets.
- **Test "Event-Guided" Preset:** Run with default and custom Pass 1 prompts. Check logs and output structure (`conversation_segments/`, `segment_annotations/`, `soundbites/`, `master_transcript.txt`, `results.yaml`).
- **Test Standard Presets:** Run "Standard" and "Transcription" presets to ensure the restored logic works correctly.

### 3. Medium Term
- Refine output structure/content.
- Tune detection thresholds.
- Implement stereo split second pass & per-channel auto speakers.
- Enhance error handling & logging further.
- Package application.
