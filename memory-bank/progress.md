# Progress Status

## What Works

### 1. Core Functionality
- ✅ Audio file processing
- ✅ Video audio extraction
- ✅ Vocal separation (Demucs)
- ✅ Sound detection (CLAP) - *Basic integration, prompts fixed*
- ✅ Event detection - *Basic integration, prompts fixed*
- ✅ Speaker Diarization (Pyannote)
- ✅ Transcription (Whisper)
- ✅ Stereo Splitting
- ✅ Audio Normalization
- ✅ Stop/Cancel Mechanism (UI -> Backend)
- ⚠️ Output Directory Structure - *Broken, pending restoration*
- ⚠️ UI Clarity & Configuration - *Confusing, pending refactor*

### 2. Features
- ✅ Multiple input formats (File, Folder, URL)
- ✅ Video audio extraction
- ✅ Audio normalization
- ✅ Vocal/Non-vocal separation
- ✅ Speaker count detection (manual/auto)
- ✅ Second-pass diarization refinement (mono path)
- ✅ Word-level timestamps/audio (optional)
- ✅ Event-guided transcription - *Basic logic fixed*
- ⚠️ Configurable Event/Sound Detection - *Prompts/settings partially disconnected from UI, pending refactor*
- ⚠️ Stereo Split Second Pass - *Not implemented*
- ⚠️ Per-channel Auto Speaker Detection (Stereo Split) - *Not implemented*

## Current Status

### 1. UI & Configuration
```status
⚠️ UI needs refactoring (Detection Tab)
⚠️ Preset interactivity for detection controls needed
⚠️ Configuration flow for detection needs rework
✅ Basic preset selection works
```

### 2. Processing Pipeline
```status
✅ Core steps (normalize, separate, diarize, transcribe) functional
✅ Stop mechanism functional
✅ Event/Sound detection runs, prompt handling improved
✅ Event-guided transcription logic improved
⚠️ Output directory structure incorrect
```

### 3. Output Organization
```status
⚠️ No unique run directory created
⚠️ No step-specific subdirectories created
✅ Basic YAML/Text output generated (but in wrong location)
```

## Implementation Progress

### 1. Completed / Fixed
- Basic audio processing pipeline
- Vocal separation (Demucs)
- Diarization & Transcription (Pyannote, Whisper)
- CLAP Integration (Sound/Event Detection)
- Stereo Splitting
- Second Pass (Mono)
- Stop mechanism implementation
- **Fixes:** `stop_event` AttributeError, `KeyError: 'workflow'`, `KeyError: 'name'`, `TypeError` in event-guided transcription loop, Initial prompt handling fixes for event/sound detection.

### 2. In Progress
- **UI Refactoring:** Creating "Detection" tab, separating/adding controls, implementing preset-based interactivity.
- **Output Directory Restoration:** Implementing unique, timestamped run directory creation with step-specific subfolders (`normalized/`, `demucs/`, `events/`, `sounds/`, etc.).
- **Configuration Flow Rework:** Aligning UI inputs (`app.py`), preset kwargs (`presets.py`), and backend config usage (`whisperBite.py`) for distinct Event and Sound detection settings.

### 3. Planned
- Testing of refactored UI and output structure.
- Investigation of detection thresholds if needed.
- Stereo split second-pass implementation.
- Per-channel auto speaker detection for stereo split.
- (Low Priority) DAC Encoding exploration.
- Packaging (Pinokio).

## Next Steps

### 1. Immediate
- Implement UI Refactoring (`app.py`: Detection Tab, controls, interactivity).
- Implement Output Directory Structure creation (`app.py`).
- Update backend config flow (`app.py`, `presets.py`, `whisperBite.py`).

### 2. Short Term
- Test UI, output structure, and detection with various presets/inputs.
- Evaluate detection accuracy/thresholds if issues persist.

### 3. Medium Term
- Implement stereo split second pass & per-channel auto speakers.
- Enhance error handling & logging further.
- Explore performance optimizations.
- Package application.
